Outline/Questions
-----------------
Initial thought based on this comment from Lanette: 
"I'd love to share with dev ops folks & Devs WHY they should care about testing. Basically, it will free them up to better fix a bug once and for good, and it will also mean fewer bugs for them to worry about."
