Outline/Questions
-----------------

Introduction of show and the purpose. Why does the world need Yet Another DevOps Podcast?

After intros, we would usually do the "Sprint Retro" where the hosts share what they've learned since the last podcast. Since this is the first one, we will just introduce the concept. And maybe talk about something cool.

Main Topic: What does DevOps mean?

Panel to discuss what the phrase means, where it is relevant, and why it's important.
