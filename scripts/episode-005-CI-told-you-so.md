* What is the difference between using a CI tool for CI, and using a CI tool to orchestrate workflow automation
* Where do you begin when wanting to start CI? What bite of the elephant goes first?
* Where does testing come into play? How do we talk about unit vs functional testing and what is used in the CI portion/build?
* How do you do a large release that has major changes but still manage to do CI? Where do you integrate?
* Preflight checkin vs checking into trunk
