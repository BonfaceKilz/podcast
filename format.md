Arrested DevOps
=============

AD is a podcast focused on sharing ideas and concepts related to DevOps and all sorts of related goodies. The target audience is not the deeply knowledgeable DevOps guru, but rather software and infrastructure practioners who want to know more about DevOps and how it can help them.

Why?
-------

1. To help DevOps newbies get ramped up on the ideas, so they can better consume the more advanced material that exists.
2. Matt has opinions and the Internet needs to hear them.
3. Allow various roles in the delivery process (other than the usual tech folks) a forum to share their thoughts (product owners, testers, data peeps, etc)

What not to do
-------

1. Be judgey about technolgy. We believe in the right tool for the job, and the right tool may differ from situation to situation.
2. Speaking of tools, don't get all tool-focused. Tools are easy. People are hard.
3. Avoid "inside baseball" as much as possible. It's fine to quote and refer to the experts, but steer clear of name-dropping.
