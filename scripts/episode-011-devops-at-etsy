   * Why do you think Etsy enjoys the reputation it does for being a shop that “get” DevOps?
   * What is the history (short version) of DevOps at Etsy?
   * Did the developers readily accept responsibility not just for writing their code but making sure it runs on prod? 
   * Was there a transition period? 
   * Does the company train everyone on DevOps or do they mostly hire DevOps experts for a separate team?
   * What does the Etsy infrastructure look like?
   * Jon Cowie was on a very similar podcast with Food Fight almost exactly two years ago. What has changed since then?
   * What advice do you give to other shops who want to get going with DevOps?
   * What mudpies (so to speak) did you guys make that can help other organizations learn?
   * Lots of talk about DevOps in small startups, web scale IT, and HUGE companies (like GE, Disney, etc). What about midsize enterprises? Not so big that they have lots of little teams that can bubble up, but not so small they can just say fuck it, let’s try something?
