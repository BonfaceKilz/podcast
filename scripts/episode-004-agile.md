Outline/Questions
-----------------

* Is it true that in Agile, anyone outside of the delivery team should "not care about how the sausage gets made"? Matt has always believed that the team is a black box to product owner, etc, and should be "feature request in, feature out". True or false?
* Should there be "dev" tasks, "tester" tasks, etc? As in, in scrum, what are the advantages/disadvantages of being really specific about the task roles?
* What is the role of a Scrum master? Does it change in a DevOps culture? If we assume that a Scrummaster is kind of like a dedicated "agile coach/cop", should/could they do it for the DevOps collaboration?
* If someone on an agile delivery team does not complete their tasks, whose fault is it? How can teams learn to hang together to avoid hanging separately, so to speak.
